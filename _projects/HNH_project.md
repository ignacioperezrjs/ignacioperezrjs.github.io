    Overview
    ---

Welcome to the HNH Energy Project, a groundbreaking initiative in the realm of green hydrogen generation. This megaproject is a testament to the future of sustainable energy, and I had the privilege of contributing to its development during my internship at Copenhagen Infrastructure Service Company SpA (CISC).

    My Role at CISC
    ---

From August 2024 to November 2024, I worked as an intern in the Project Management Office (PMO) at CISC. During my internship at Copenhagen Infrastructure Service Company SpA (CISC), I had the unique opportunity to contribute to the HNH Energy Project, a pioneering initiative in green hydrogen generation. My role in the PMO was pivotal in optimizing document control processes, which are crucial for the efficient management of large-scale projects. By leveraging tools such as Python, Microsoft Excel, and the Omega platform, I was able to enhance the efficiency and scalability of document management within the PMO. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also provided me with valuable insights into the intricacies of managing sustainable energy projects.

Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) I signed, I am unable to disclose specific details about the documentation processes. However, I can share that my work involved optimizing document control to enhance efficiency and scalability within the PMO.

    My Contributions and Learnings
    ---

Over the course of four months, one of the key achievements during my internship was the implementation of the Omega platform, which led to a 15.45% increase in document processing efficiency (TdE - Tasa de Eficiencia) and a 12.5% reduction in average processing time (TPBA - Tiempo Promedio de BÃºsqueda y Archivo) within just two weeks. These improvements aligned with CISC's objectives to streamline document management processes, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the PMO. While the initial results were promising, they were based on a short evaluation period, and further analysis is required to fully validate the outcomes. Nonetheless, the scalability of the solution suggests its potential for broader application across CISC's global projects, contingent on the company's investment in time and resources.

However, the most valuable learning experience was the in-depth analysis and understanding of the documents I worked on, which provided me with a comprehensive view of project management in the green energy sector.

    Tools and Techniques Learned
    ---

Throughout my internship, I utilized various computational tools, including Python 3 (pandas and file with different extension generation), Microsoft Excel (dynamic tables, macros), and Omega, to streamline document management processes. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also provided me with valuable insights into managing large-scale green hydrogen projects.
