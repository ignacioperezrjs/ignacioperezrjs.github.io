    Overview
    ---
Welcome to the HNH Energy Project, a groundbreaking initiative in the realm of green hydrogen generation. This megaproject is a testament to the future of sustainable energy, and I had the privilege of contributing to its development during my internship at Copenhagen Infrastructure Service Company SpA (CISC).

    My Role at CISC
    ---

From August 2024 to November 2024, I worked as an intern in the Project Management Office (PMO) at CISC. My primary responsibility was to assist in the preparation and management of project documentation. Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) I signed, I am unable to disclose specific details about the documentation processes. However, I can share that my work involved optimizing document control to enhance efficiency and scalability within the PMO.

    Tools and Techniques learned

    ---

Throughout my internship, I utilized various computational tools, including Python 3 (pandas and file with different extension generation), Microsoft Excel (dynamic tables, macros), and Omega, to streamline document management processes. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also provided me with valuable insights into managing large-scale green hydrogen projects.
