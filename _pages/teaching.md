I have spent a significant portion of my career as a private instructor, though I am no longer actively teaching. My experience spans various subjects, including Python programming, Wolfram Mathematica for linear algebra and calculus, and mathematics.

### University Teaching Experience

#### Pontifical Catholic University of Chile

- **Optimization (Minor in Bachelor's Program)**
  - Led student groups in tackling real-life optimization problems.
  - Guided students to successfully run simulations and code their solutions.

- **Laboratory Calculus #2 Assistant**
  - Taught students to use Wolfram Mathematica for representing mathematical problems, including double integrals and summations.

- **Laboratory Linear Algebra**
  - Assisted students in visually representing vectorial and 3D problems using Wolfram Mathematica.

#### Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD)

- **Pre-Calculus**
  - Provided foundational mathematics instruction to prepare students for advanced calculus courses.

### Private Teaching Experience

- **Python Programming**
  - Conducted personalized lessons for groups of 1-4 students.
  - Focused on enhancing programming skills and understanding of Python.
  - Developed strong communication and personal teaching skills through tailored instruction.

This page serves as a static overview of my teaching journey. In the future, I may expand it to include detailed pages for each course.
