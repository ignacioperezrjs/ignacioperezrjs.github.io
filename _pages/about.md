Hey there! I'm excited to share a bit about myself. I'm a `25-year-old` originally from the lively city of Santiago, Chile. Most of my life has been spent soaking up the vibrant culture there, but in July 2023, I took a leap and moved to Melbourne, Australia. I was part of a bilateral exchange program at `Monash University`, which was an amazing opportunity to expand my academic and cultural horizons.

Growing up, I was all about `rugby`. I started playing when I was just 9 years old, and it taught me a lot about teamwork and discipline. However, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I shifted my focus to my studies in `Electrical Engineering` at the `Pontifical Catholic University of Chile`. It was a tough transition, but it really pushed me to excel in my academics and life in general.

Outside of engineering, I'm a bit of an adventurer. I've tried `paragliding`, and one of my big dreams is to get a pilot license for it someday. There's just something incredible about flying high above the world and seeing everything from a new perspective.

In my downtime, I enjoy playing football with friends, going to the gym, relaxing in the sauna, or reading a good book. These activities help me stay balanced and energized, whether I'm solving a tricky engineering problem or exploring new opportunities.

For me, life is all about `growing and learning`. I'm always on the lookout for new things to learn and ways to `contribute` to projects that matter.
